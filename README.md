README- Beach weather

### Project Overview

This is mobile application that uses current weather that will allow our users to see the state of some of the famous beaches on Montenegro coast that they want to visit.
This mobile application based on RTEPMS platform.

Sometimes we have to go quite a distance to find a certain beach, but before that it is advisable to see what kind of weather will wait for us and whether the conditions are good or too dangerous to swim. 
This app will allow users to find a particular beach by displaying the current flag color on it.
Flag color will be:
Green - Harmless and safe swim.
Yellow - Swimming is restricted and can be dangerous. Weak swimmers are discouraged from entering the water. For others, enhanced care and caution should be exercised.
Red -   It's forbidden to swim.
Red Flags :
The most serious of all beach warning flags, red flags warn swimmers of severe hazards in the water. One red flag means that the swimmers is high or there are dangerous currents or both. Though you can still swim if there is a red flag, you should use extreme caution and go in the water only if youâ€™re a keen swimmer.
Two red flags:
Two red flags, however, means that the water is closed to swimming, as conditions are too dangerous for even the strongest swimmers. In some communities, red flags feature the symbol of a swimmer with a white line through it, indicating that swimming is prohibited.

You can also find other beach warning signals with different messages
